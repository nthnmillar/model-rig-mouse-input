<!-- This brings in the ability to load custom 3D objects in the .gltf file format. Blender allows the ability to export to this format out the box -->

<!-- Our HTML consists of a loading animation (currently commented out until we need it), a wrapper div and our all-important canvas element. The canvas is what Three.js uses to render our scene, and the CSS sets this at 100% viewport size. We also load in two dependencies at the bottom of our HTML file: Three.js, and GLTFLoader (GLTF is the format that our 3D model is imported as). Both of these dependencies are available as npm modules.

The CSS also consists of a small amount of centering styling and the rest is just the loading animation; really nothing more to it than that. You can now collapse your HTML and CSS panels, we will delve into that very little for the rest of the tutorial. -->
